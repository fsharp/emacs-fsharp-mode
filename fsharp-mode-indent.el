When this variable is non-nil, two things happen when a buffer is set
to `fsharp-mode':

    1. `fsharp-indent-offset' is guessed from existing code in the buffer.
       Only guessed values between 2 and 8 are considered.  If a valid
       guess can't be made (perhaps because you are visiting a new
       file), then the value in `fsharp-indent-offset' is used.

    2. `indent-tabs-mode' is turned off if `fsharp-indent-offset' does not
       equal `tab-width' (`indent-tabs-mode' is never turned on by
       Fsharp mode).  This means that for newly written code, tabs are
       only inserted in indentation if one tab is one indentation
       level, otherwise only spaces are used.

Note that both these settings occur *after* `fsharp-mode-hook' is run,
so if you want to defeat the automagic configuration, you must also
set `fsharp-smart-indentation' to nil in your `fsharp-mode-hook'."

line indentation.  If the previous line is such a comment line (as

comment) statement immediately preceding the region.

This is useful when code blocks are moved or yanked, when enclosing
control structures are introduced or removed, or to reformat code

If a numeric prefix argument is given, it will be used as the value of
the indentation offset.  Else the value of `fsharp-indent-offset' will be

Warning: The region must be consistently indented before this function
is called!  This function does not compute proper indentation from
scratch (that's impossible in Fsharp), it merely adjusts the existing
indentation to be correct in context.

Warning: This function really has no idea what to do with
non-indenting comment lines, and shifts them as if they were indenting
comment lines.  Fixing this appears to require telepathy.

Special cases: whitespace is deleted from blank lines; continuation
lines are shifted by the same amount their initial line was shifted,

initial line; and comment lines beginning in column 1 are ignored."

;; Functions for marking regions
(defun fsharp-mark-block (&optional extend just-move)
  "Mark following block of lines.  With prefix arg, mark structure.
Easier to use than explain.  It sets the region to an `interesting'
block of succeeding lines.  If point is on a blank line, it goes down to
the next non-blank line.  That will be the start of the region.  The end
of the region depends on the kind of line at the start:

 - If a comment, the region will include all succeeding comment lines up
   to (but not including) the next non-comment line (if any).

 - Else if a prefix arg is given, and the line begins one of these
   structures:

     if elif else try except finally for while def class

   the region will be set to the body of the structure, including
   following blocks that `belong' to it, but excluding trailing blank
   and comment lines.  E.g., if on a `try' statement, the `try' block
   and all (if any) of the following `except' and `finally' blocks
   that belong to the `try' structure will be in the region.  Ditto
   for if/elif/else, for/else and while/else structures, and (a bit
   degenerate, since they're always one-block structures) def and
   class blocks.

 - Else if no prefix argument is given, and the line begins a Fsharp
   block (see list above), and the block is not a `one-liner' (i.e.,
   the statement ends with a colon, not with code), the region will
   include all succeeding lines up to (but not including) the next
   code statement (if any) that's indented no more than the starting
   line, except that trailing blank and comment lines are excluded.
   E.g., if the starting line begins a multi-statement `def'
   structure, the region will be set to the full function definition,
   but without any trailing `noise' lines.

 - Else the region will include all succeeding lines up to (but not
   including) the next blank line, or code or indenting-comment line
   indented strictly less than the starting line.  Trailing indenting
   comment lines are included in this case, but not trailing blank
   lines.

  "Set region to body of def (or class, with prefix arg) enclosing point.
Pushes the current mark, then point, on the mark ring (all language
modes do this, but although it's handy it's never documented ...).

In most Emacs language modes, this function bears at least a
hallucinogenic resemblance to `\\[fsharp-end-of-def-or-class]' and
`\\[fsharp-beginning-of-def-or-class]'.

And in earlier versions of Fsharp mode, all 3 were tightly connected.
Turned out that was more confusing than useful: the `goto start' and
`goto end' commands are usually used to search through a file, and
people expect them to act a lot like `search backward' and `search
forward' string-search commands.  But because Fsharp `def' and `class'
can nest to arbitrary levels, finding the smallest def containing
point cannot be done via a simple backward search: the def containing
point may not be the closest preceding def, or even the closest
preceding def that's indented less.  The fancy algorithm required is
appropriate for the usual uses of this `mark' command, but not for the
`goto' variations.

So the def marked by this command may not be the one either of the
`goto' commands find: If point is on a blank or non-indenting comment
line, moves back to start of the closest preceding code statement or
indenting comment line.  If this is a `def' statement, that's the def
we use.  Else searches for the smallest enclosing `def' block and uses
that.  Else signals an error.

When an enclosing def is found: The mark is left immediately beyond
the last line of the def block.  Point is left at the start of the
def, except that: if the def is preceded by a number of comment lines
followed by (at most) one optional blank line, point is left at the
start of the comments; else if the def is preceded by a blank line,
point is left at its start.

The intent is to mark the containing def/class and its associated
documentation, to make moving and duplicating functions and classes
pleasant."
